# bt-tether

## Description

**bt-tether** is a small script that enables Bluetooth Tethering on your Jolla Phone. I could not find any software that did that realiably so I tried my hand at it.

It is **quite experimental** and a little hacky. It’s only been tested on my Jolla Phone in developer mode. I’m putting it here without any warranty, however I’d be glad to receive some feedback and I’ll do my best to improve it.

**bt-tether** can connect several devices at once to whatever is the current connection of the phone (Mobile or WLAN). It uses the `pand` daemon that should be installed already, along with specially crafted scripts and an adhoc DNS relay.
